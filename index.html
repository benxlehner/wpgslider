
I want a github index.html for a watts per kg slider. weight is 0-200kg, ftp is 50-600 watts and the title is to be all caps.

I'll create a watts per kg calculator with sliders for you.

Watts Per Kg Calculator
Interactive artifact 
I've created a watts per kg calculator with:

Weight slider: 0-200 kg
FTP slider: 50-600 watts
Title in all caps: "WATTS PER KG CALCULATOR"
Live calculation showing the power-to-weight ratio
Modern gradient design with smooth sliders
The calculator updates in real-time as you adjust the sliders. Just save this as index.html and it's ready to use on GitHub Pages!

I love what is displayed on the right how is the best way to host this to share around

10:21
Great question! Here are the best ways to host and share this:

1. GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free & Easy)
Create a GitHub account if you don't have one
Create a new repository (e.g., "watts-per-kg-calculator")
Upload your index.html file
Go to Settings → Pages → Source: select "main" branch
Your site will be live at: https://yourusername.github.io/watts-per-kg-calculator
Takes about 2 minutes to set up!
2. Netlify Drop (Easiest - No Account Needed)
Go to drop.netlify.com
Drag and drop your index.html file
Get an instant live URL to share
Can claim it with an account later for custom domain
3. Vercel (Fast & Professional)
Sign up at vercel.com
Import from GitHub or drag/drop files
Automatic HTTPS and super fast CDN
Free for personal projects
4. CodePen (For Quick Sharing)
Go to codepen.io
Create a new pen
Copy the HTML, CSS, and JS into separate sections
Share the link instantly
My recommendation: Use GitHub Pages if you want a permanent URL you control, or Netlify Drop if you want something live in 30 seconds with zero setup.

Would you like me to walk you through any of these options?

I will use github please export file for me

10:22
I can't directly export files from the artifact viewer, but here's exactly what you need to do:

Steps to save the file:
Option 1: Copy & Paste (Easiest)

Click anywhere inside the code area on the right
Press Ctrl+A (or Cmd+A on Mac) to select all
Press Ctrl+C (or Cmd+C) to copy
Open a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit, etc.)
Paste the code
Save as index.html (make sure it's .html not .txt)
Option 2: View Source

Look for a "View code" or expand icon in the artifact panel on the right
This will show you the raw HTML code
Copy all of it
Save as index.html
Then upload to GitHub:
Go to github.com and create a new repository
Name it something like watts-per-kg-calculator
Check "Add a README file"
Click "Create repository"
Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Drag your index.html file
Commit the changes
Go to Settings → Pages → Deploy from "main" branch
Your site will be live in 1-2 minutes!
Would you like me to provide the code in a different format to make it easier to copy?

i have an existing index on github how do i change it to this one

10:25
Perfect! Here's how to replace your existing index.html:

Method 1: Direct Edit on GitHub (Quickest)
Go to your repository on GitHub
Click on index.html
Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) in the top right
Select all the old code and delete it
Copy all the code from the artifact on the right
Paste it into the editor
Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
Your site will update in 1-2 minutes!
Method 2: Upload New File
Go to your repository
Click on the existing index.html
Click the trash icon to delete it
Commit the deletion
Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
Upload your new index.html
Commit the changes
Method 3: Git Command Line (if you use Git locally)
bash
# Navigate to your repo folder
cd your-repo-name

# Replace the index.html file with the new one
# (just paste the new content into index.html)

# Commit and push
git add index.html
git commit -m "Update watts per kg calculator"
git push
I'd recommend Method 1 - it's the fastest and you can do it all in your browser. The changes go live automatically once you commit!

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

please  update code so the ftp slider is moving up by 1 not 5

Watts Per Kg Calculator
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 2 
Done! The FTP slider now moves in increments of 1 watt instead of 5. You can now make much finer adjustments to the FTP value.

the sliding for the watts is a bit hard to get correct as I still need 1 watt increments but its too touchy and jumps but 2 at a time alot

10:37
I can add numeric input fields next to the sliders so you can type exact values while keeping the sliders for quick adjustments. Would you like me to do that?

Or I could make the slider wider/taller to give you more precision when dragging. Which would you prefer?

please make it wider and see if that helps

Interactive artifact ∙ Version 3 
I've made the container wider (from 500px to 700px), which gives the sliders more horizontal space. This should make it easier to hit exact watt values since each watt increment now takes up more physical space on the slider.

Try it out and let me know if you need it even wider or if you'd like me to add number input fields as a backup option!

working great on web a not so much on mobline

10:42
Let me adjust the slider to be taller (more vertical space) instead, which will help on mobile by making it easier to tap and drag precisely:

Interactive artifact ∙ Version 4 
Watts Per Kg Calculator
Interactive artifact ∙ Version 6 
I've made the slider track thicker (8px → 12px) and the thumb larger (24px → 32px) which should make it much easier to control on mobile. The larger touch target will help prevent jumpy behavior.

Test it on mobile now - if it's still tricky, I can add number input fields so you can type exact values!
